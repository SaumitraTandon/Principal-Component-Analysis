# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

This project demonstrates the implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using Python. PCA is a powerful statistical technique used to reduce the dimensionality of datasets, increasing interpretability while minimizing information loss.

## Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to perform PCA on a dataset to reduce its dimensionality and visualize the results. The notebook covers the following steps:
1. Importing necessary libraries.
2. Loading and exploring the dataset.
3. Scaling the data for PCA.
4. Applying PCA to the dataset.
5. Visualizing the principal components.

## Installation
To run this project locally, you'll need to install the necessary Python libraries. You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, you can install the libraries individually:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

### Jupyter Notebook
This project is contained within a Jupyter Notebook. Ensure that you have Jupyter installed:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pca-project.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd pca-project
    ```
3. Start the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```
4. Open the `principal_component_analysis.ipynb` notebook and run the cells to perform PCA on the dataset.

### Example
The notebook provides a comprehensive guide to performing PCA, including how to visualize the principal components. You'll see examples such as:

```python
# Applying PCA
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

pca = PCA(n_components=2)
X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X_scaled)

# Visualizing the principal components
plt.scatter(X_pca[:, 0], X_pca[:, 1], c=y)
plt.xlabel('First Principal Component')
plt.ylabel('Second Principal Component')
plt.show()
```
